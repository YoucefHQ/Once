# Once: The best way to be productive and limit the usage of time-consuming websites.

## Features

This is a basic Chrome Extensions boilerplate to help you write modular and modern Javascript code, load CSS easily and [automatic reload the browser on code changes](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html#automatic-refresh).

This extension uses:

- [React 17](https://reactjs.org)
- [Webpack 5](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)
- [eslint-config-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-react-app)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Installing and Running

### Procedures:

1. Check if your [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version is >= **14**.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `npm start`
5. Load your extension on Chrome following:
   1. Access `chrome://extensions/`
   2. Check `Developer mode`
   3. Click on `Load unpacked extension`
   4. Select the `build` folder.

## Structure

All the code is placed in the `src` folder.

## Webpack auto-reload and HRM

To make your workflow much more efficient Once uses the [webpack server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html) to development (started with `npm start`) with auto reload feature that reloads the browser automatically every time that you save some file in your editor.

You can run the dev mode on other port if you want. Just specify the env var `port` like this:

```
$ PORT=6002 npm run start
```

## Packing

After the development of your extension run the command

```
$ NODE_ENV=production npm run build
```

Now, the content of `build` folder will be the extension ready to be submitted to the Chrome Web Store. Just take a look at the [official guide](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish) to more infos about publishing.
